*********Last Done (last done at the top)*********
-get_move function in GameConsoleView class, game_console_view module
-Deciding whether to pass a disk object or not in the add_disk function
-Placing disk objects in board




*********Questions*********
1: about separating game logic from main game module:
     -encapsulated is_valid_move and check_available_moves, was that OK?
2: how to not import "circular modules" but still get the type hint in function definitions?
