*********To Do*********

------Model------




------View------
.add and test simple add disk functionality, with user input 
     -check player-disk association

.add calculate score functionality (Player does this really)

.board view: add grid numbers on the left and upper sides (user will need
this reference when entering the coordinates of his move)



.when adding disk: 
-validate that make_move position input is within the size of board
-that it is within available moves




------UML------

.Update UML with changes in model - new rules module







*********Last Done (last done at the top)*********

-get_move function in GameConsoleView class, game_console_view module
-Deciding whether to pass a disk object or not in the add_disk function
-Placing disk objects in board







*********Questions*********

1: about separating game logic from main game module:
     -encapsulated is_valid_move and check_available_moves, was that OK?
