********To Do*********

game_controller implementation:
1. player creation //DONE
2. (inner while loop) 



.The source code should be well commented and organized
.All classes and methods should be documented with docstrings
.Update UML with changes in model, there are new rules module




*********Known problems*********




*********Last Done (last done at the top)*********
.creating player mode user choice input (incomplete, validation needed)



*********Questions*********
1: about separating game logic from main game module:
     -encapsulated is_valid_move and check_available_moves, was that OK?
2: how to avoid "circular modules" but still get the type hint in function definitions?
